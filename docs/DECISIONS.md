## 0001 — Native SwiftUI, not a web shell (2026-09-13)

**Decision.** The app is native SwiftUI over a bundled snapshot. No web view,
no JavaScript runtime, no Capacitor.

**Why.** The product's only differentiator that nobody else in this niche
delivers honestly is that "Data Not Collected" is literally true ([moved to private strategy notes]). A native app
with zero third-party SDKs and one plain GET for snapshot refresh is the
simplest thing that makes that claim auditable. It also answers App Review's
4.2 / 4.3(b) "repackaged website" risk directly — the research's top review
risk — because there is no website to repackage.

**Cost.** Chelsea's day-to-day stack is TypeScript and Python; Swift is a
second language for maintenance. Mitigated by keeping the app thin: all data
shaping lives in `pipeline/` (Python), the app renders a contract.

**Reversible.** Yes, while the app is small.

## 0002 — Data posture: none (2026-09-13)

Per DATA-GOVERNANCE-STANDARD §4a the declared analytics posture is **"none"**.
No analytics, no crash reporting, no telemetry, no accounts. Snapshot refresh
is a GET of a static file from infrastructure Chelsea controls with access
logging minimised and documented in the privacy notice. This is a per-product
choice; the portfolio's other products made the opposite one the same day.

## 0003 — Paid up front, one price (2026-09-13, provisional)

One-time purchase at the App Store, no IAP, no subscription: no StoreKit code,
no receipt validation, nothing to phone home about. [moved to private strategy notes]

## 0004 — Name: undecided

Owner's call. Do not use "Signal".
